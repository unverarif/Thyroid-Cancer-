Thyroid Cancer Classification Project
This project has been developed to diagnose thyroid cancer using machine learning methods. Here are the main steps of the project:

Step 1: Data Preparation
Thyroid cancer data was processed efficiently using the Pycaret library.
Data preprocessing steps involved data cleaning, filling in missing values, and applying feature engineering.

Step 2: Machine Learning
Automated machine learning tools from Pycaret were used to experiment with and compare different classification algorithms.
The best-performing model was selected.

Step 3: Classification Results
The ability to diagnose thyroid cancer using the best model was achieved.
The project's outcomes were evaluated and presented.
